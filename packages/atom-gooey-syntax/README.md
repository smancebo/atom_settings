# gooey-syntax theme

### premise
A greeny-blue theme with purple/red hints.
Inspired after seeing [@mrmrs_](https://twitter.com/mrmrs_)'s terminal theme while he was giving a talk on CSS. It was delicious!

### requirements
Atom 1.13.0+ uses the new class prefix for syntax instead of the shadow DOM. If you want to use this syntax on older versions of atom, checkout the version 0.2.1.

### conclusion
I hope you loves it! ðŸŒŸ
